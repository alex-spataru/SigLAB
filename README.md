# SigLAB

SigLAB is a multi-platform, multi-purpose serial data visualization program. The goal of this project is to allow embedded developers & makers to easily visualize, present & analize the data generated by their projects and devices, without the need of writing specialized computer software for each project.

The need for this project arose during the development of the Ground Station Software for several CanSat-based competitions in which I participate. It's simply not sustainable to develop and maintain different GSS programs for each competition & project. The smart solution is to have one common Ground Station software and let each CanSat define how the data is presented to the end user using an extensible communication protocol. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to almost any type of project that involves some kind of data acquisition & measurement.


## Communication Protocol

For the moment, the idea is to implement a communication protocol based on JSON, the communication protocol should:

- Define the name of each data field
- Define the values for each data field (and measurement units)
- Define how the data should be displayed (e.g. graph or text)
- Implement support for vector variables (e.g. for representing accelerometer data)

## Data Export

SigLAB MUST be able to export all the data received in a CSV file for further analysis (e.g. in MatLAB).

## TODOs

- [ ] Define basic JSON parameters for the communication protocol
- [ ] Implement CSV export functionality
- [ ] Implement data display functionality
- [ ] Implement graph display functionality
- [ ] Add data fields pane
- [ ] Write a portable library in C for generating SigLAB packets 
- [x] Implement serial interface bridge
- [x] Implement main user interface
- [x] Implement serial console
